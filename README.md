Since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic
back in March 2020, the virus has claimed more than 2.5 million lives globally with upwards
of 113 million cases being confirmed by laboratory tests (March 2021).
The pandemic has impacted almost every corner of life, causing global economies to stall,
changing the way we work and interact with our loved ones, and stretching healthcare systems
to the limit. Governments around the world have been forced to implement harsh restrictions
on human activity to curb the spread of the virus.
COVID-19 vaccination is now offering a way to transition out of this phase of the pandemic.
Without them, many scientists believe that natural herd immunity would not have been
sufficient to restore society to its normal status quo and that it would have resulted in extreme
fatality.
Online Vaccination is now very important role for human being from every corner of the world.
I choose this topic because I think it’s a running and serious issue for the whole world right
now. So, this paper will really work for upcoming software developer who will work on
vaccination process and its eco-system. And that’s why I think my topic has very important
role for society and the humankind.

Nowadays Online software is very essential for everyone. It’s fast, simple and very easy to
use. Throughout this year, our health has been the most important things that we need to take
care of because there are many dangerous diseases these days that can affect many people
without knowing age and gender. By that, many people will have to go to the hospital or any
medical center to get the treatment or to get the medicine for curing the disease. But, these
days the Covid 19 cases have increased rapidly and this makes the situation even worse
because the hospital will be full with the Covid 19 patients. This will make the hospital a
high-risk place to go because there are many Covid 19 patients there and it might infect other
people that come to the hospital. Because of this, it might be hard for other people to get
treatments or medicines if they feel sick or in pain. So, with the technology that we have
right now, we can solve this problem easily. The way to solve it is by having a website that
provides content about health or provides online medical services. This is because most
people nowadays are Internet users so having a health website is very beneficial.
Having a COVID-19 Vaccine website may bring many benefits such as:
Offering a full time service
When making a COVID-19 Vaccine website or website that offers an online vaccine service,
it might be beneficial for patients because if they need vaccine service, they can go to the
website and get medical advice from there. This is because people can not expect when or
where they will get sick or caught a disease. As for the medical center, it will open only for
working hours only. So, this might be hard for them if they need medical treatments after
working hours. With the existence of these websites, it will be convenient for the patients to
get vaccine services online whenever or wherever they are.
Provide medical & vaccine information to people
Besides providing a medical & vaccine service, these h COVID-19 Vaccine websites also
can provide some medical information that might be beneficial for other people. This is
because many people did not have much knowledge about medical and health. So, by
making COVID-19 Vaccine websites, people can discover more information about vaccine
or medical through the website that they can find online.
Easier vaccination accessibility for everyone
In this world, there are some people that have their reasons why they can not afford to go to
the hospital. It might be financial factors or maybe it is because they feel afraid or
embarrassed to go to the hospital. Because of this, they refuse to go to the hospital to seek for
medical advice or to get treatment. To overcome this problem, we can make a COVID-19
Vaccine website so they can get some medical advice without going to the hospital or they
can register for vaccine from home.
